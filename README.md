# Genre Classification for Spotify Tracks

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project that aims to classify the genre of Spotify tracks based on their audio features. The project utilizes the "spotify-tracks-dataset" to train and evaluate a genre classification model that can automatically categorize tracks into specific genres.

## Dataset

The "spotify-tracks-dataset" is a tabular dataset in CSV format, containing a diverse range of tracks across 125 different genres. Each track is associated with audio features such as duration, explicit lyrics, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, and time signature. The dataset also includes the genre label for each track, serving as the target variable for training the genre classification model.
